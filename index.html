    <p> If you volunteer for the experiment you will answer a series of questions related to charts displayed on the screen. Each question will show either a line chart or a stacked area chart (the chart plotted below serving as a baseline). This experiment will take around 20 minutes. Your responses will be recorded, but you will remain anonymous. The research may be reported in student work, but no-one should be able to identify you and at no point will your identity be divulged.By taking part in the experiment you are indicating informed consent. You are free to withdraw from the experiment at any time. Finally, please let me know at: sc21ai@leeds.ac.uk, if you have any questions or would like to discuss anything with me.!</p>
